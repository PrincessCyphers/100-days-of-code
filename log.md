# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Nov 8, 2021
*Created my first Java GUI. It's a simple GUI with a "click here" link counting the number of clicks. I followed a tutorial inspired by Pirinceton's CS example lesson. Relatively easy to understand as long as i remeber the steps i.e. create a frame, create a button and panel within that has a label, add methods for each element. Starting to get more comfortable with constructors and classes. Introduced to Java Swing for the GUI.*

### Day 1: Nov 9, 2021
*A more complex build of the GUI, with the creation of a login GUI. It's making more sense, I'm more comfortable with the basic construction of a GUI. Building on this would include adding a redirect once the user logs in. Also, allowing for the creation of an acount, before trying to log in could be the next level up for a GUI.*

### Day 2: Nov 10, 2021
*Today was building more on the Java foundations by creating an email app. Constructors are making more sense and I'm better understanding the calling methods. A build on today's project would be incoporating the GUI method, to then allow a 'user' to login with the details generated by app. Seperation of main class from the rest allowed for better understanding and code reading.*

### Day 3: Nov 11, 2021
*Switched it up slightly by buiding a student management system. I need to practice arrays more and using if statements as I always forget the () in the if. Good recap of arrays and their use, and nice to see how code can be kept relatively tidy using OOP. Starting to understand the basic principles and embed them.*

### Day 4: Nov 12, 2021
*Created a simple banking app. i was following a video tutorial and was able to work ahead and use the video to check/ mark my work. Opted to have input from the user for the account name and added setCustomerID as additional elements for practive. I was introduced to JSeperator whilst looking for a shortcut for inserting break lines. Not suitable for this project, but has given ideas for next time. Switch statements need more practice just to get used to them. and more if statements.*

### Day 5, 6, 7 and 8: Nov 13 - 16, 2021
*I was behind on my #100DaysOfCode due to not coding over the weekend. I've made up by coding (productively) for approx 10hrs over 2days, which will be followed by some more intense hours and project work. I created a Coronavirus tracker app using springboot for the famework, customised with Thymeleaf and bootstrap CSS. This was an intro to Springboot, but its relatively easy to use. Will create a few more front and back emd products using it to get more confortable. Really enjoyed working with HTML in a different environment, and this may be my new and current prefered method for webpages. Will play more and see other limitations. Improvement on the app includes upgrading the desing and layout of page, and stating if changes from previous day are positive or negative. perhaps if statements?*

### Day 9 & 10: Nov 17-18, 2021
*Needed respite after the bootstrap 'bootcamp' and created a game once more- Brick Breaker. Got to use more and new event listeners, and introduced to graphics and paint methods. Also introduced to keyEvents. I want to create more with these. Compiler stopped responding part way, so not actully certain the game works, but I'm confident in the code.*
