# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Nov 8, 2021
*Created my first Java GUI. It's a simple GUI with a "click here" link counting the number of clicks. I followed a tutorial inspired by Pirinceton's CS example lesson. Relatively easy to understand as long as i remeber the steps i.e. create a frame, create a button and panel within that has a label, add methods for each element. Starting to get more comfortable with constructors and classes. Introduced to Java Swing for the GUI.*

### Day 1: Nov 9, 2021
*A more complex build of the GUI, with the creation of a login GUI. It's making more sense, I'm more comfortable with the basic construction of a GUI. Building on this would include adding a redirect once the user logs in. Also, allowing for the creation of an acount, before trying to log in could be the next level up for a GUI.*

### Day 2: Nov 10, 2021
*Today was building more on the Java foundations by creating an email app. Constructors are making more sense and I'm better understanding the calling methods. A build on today's project would be incoporating the GUI method, to then allow a 'user' to login with the details generated by app. Seperation of main class from the rest allowed for better understanding and code reading.*

### Day 3: Nov 11, 2021
*Switched it up slightly by buiding a student management system. I need to practice arrays more and using if statements as I always forget the () in the if. Good recap of arrays and their use, and nice to see how code can be kept relatively tidy using OOP. Starting to understand the basic principles and embed them.*
