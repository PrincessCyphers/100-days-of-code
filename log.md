# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Nov 8, 2021
*Created my first Java GUI. It's a simple GUI with a "click here" link counting the number of clicks. I followed a tutorial inspired by Pirinceton's CS example lesson. Relatively easy to understand as long as i remeber the steps i.e. create a frame, create a button and panel within that has a label, add methods for each element. Starting to get more comfortable with constructors and classes. Introduced to Java Swing for the GUI.*

### Day 1: Nov 9, 2021
*A more complex build of the GUI, with the creation of a login GUI. It's making more sense, I'm more comfortable with the basic construction of a GUI. Building on this would include adding a redirect once the user logs in. Also, allowing for the creation of an acount, before trying to log in could be the next level up for a GUI.*

### Day 2: Nov 10, 2021
*Today was building more on the Java foundations by creating an email app. Constructors are making more sense and I'm better understanding the calling methods. A build on today's project would be incoporating the GUI method, to then allow a 'user' to login with the details generated by app. Seperation of main class from the rest allowed for better understanding and code reading.*

### Day 3: Nov 11, 2021
*Switched it up slightly by buiding a student management system. I need to practice arrays more and using if statements as I always forget the () in the if. Good recap of arrays and their use, and nice to see how code can be kept relatively tidy using OOP. Starting to understand the basic principles and embed them.*

### Day 4: Nov 12, 2021
*Created a simple banking app. i was following a video tutorial and was able to work ahead and use the video to check/ mark my work. Opted to have input from the user for the account name and added setCustomerID as additional elements for practive. I was introduced to JSeperator whilst looking for a shortcut for inserting break lines. Not suitable for this project, but has given ideas for next time. Switch statements need more practice just to get used to them. and more if statements.*

### Day 5, 6, 7 and 8: Nov 13 - 16, 2021
*I was behind on my #100DaysOfCode due to not coding over the weekend. I've made up by coding (productively) for approx 10hrs over 2days, which will be followed by some more intense hours and project work. I created a Coronavirus tracker app using springboot for the famework, customised with Thymeleaf and bootstrap CSS. This was an intro to Springboot, but its relatively easy to use. Will create a few more front and back emd products using it to get more confortable. Really enjoyed working with HTML in a different environment, and this may be my new and current prefered method for webpages. Will play more and see other limitations. Improvement on the app includes upgrading the desing and layout of page, and stating if changes from previous day are positive or negative. perhaps if statements?*

### Day 9 & 10: Nov 17-18, 2021
*Needed respite after the bootstrap 'bootcamp' and created a game once more- Brick Breaker. Got to use more and new event listeners, and introduced to graphics and paint methods. Also introduced to keyEvents. I want to create more with these. Compiler stopped responding part way, so not actully certain the game works, but I'm confident in the code.*

### Day 11: NOv 19, 2021
*I was up until 4am yesterday, so today wasnt spent physically coding. I took some tim eout and baked, and watched online tutorials and java videos. I also read up more on yesterday's new concepts of VK_Codes and keyEvents. 


### Day 12: Nov 20, 2021
*It was bothering me that I couldn't load the game, so much so that it featured in my sleep. I asked @shatokidnigel to download and play the game, and they reported a similar issue to what I'd experienced. I decided to inspect the code. I suspect changing the order in the main class so SetVisible was last masy have influnced it. Prev SertVisible was before panel construction was finalised. I also added else statements for the if condition in the ball-paddle intersect method. Game now functions as expected. Improving would be adding game instruction a the beginning, and possibly adding multiple layers. Option to save score would be added advantage. I've also seen an issue where once the ball is stuck in one particular loop, game can't be won, so adding catchers for that. Adding variety in the way the ball bounces back depending on hitting the corner of paddle for e.g


### Day 25: Dec 6, 2021
* I hadn't realised just how long ago I'd stopped updating the log. The most recent porject was intense, and had me stressed. I've now completed my first CRUD app using SpringBoot, H2 Hibernate db and Maven. The first few days of app creation were relatively smooth. I've also used the commits as mini log books to help understand what changes i was making and why. I got stuck on testing, as my tests kept failing. An angel in the form of @SolangeUG took the time to look at my code and correct it and gave me a working example. her work introduced me and led to a better understanding of Hibernate H2 db. I was also introduced to Project Lombok, which i will use going forwards. A lot of my issues are also attributed to the age of my machine, so I look forward to working on a newer and hopefully faster machine. I've finished the app, will ask a colleague to test it for me. further work will be adding more complexity, e.g. asking for login to change the password, asking for confirmation before deleting a user, and creating different level of access and permmissions to the app. I'll continue working with springboot until i'm more comfortable.
