# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Nov 8, 2021
*Created my first Java GUI. It's a simple GUI with a "click here" link counting the number of clicks. I followed a tutorial inspired by Pirinceton's CS example lesson. Relatively easy to understand as long as i remeber the steps i.e. create a frame, create a button and panel within that has a label, add methods for each element. Starting to get more comfortable with constructors and classes. Introduced to Java Swing for the GUI.*

### Day 1: Nov 9, 2021
*A more complex build of the GUI, with the creation of a login GUI. It's making more sense, I'm more comfortable with the basic construction of a GUI. Building on this would include adding a redirect once the user logs in. Also, allowing for the creation of an acount, before trying to log in could be the next level up for a GUI.*

### Day 2: Nov 10, 2021
*Today was building more on the Java foundations by creating an email app. Constructors are making more sense and I'm better understanding the calling methods. A build on today's project would be incoporating the GUI method, to then allow a 'user' to login with the details generated by app. Seperation of main class from the rest allowed for better understanding and code reading.*
